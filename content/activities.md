## Main Conference

The main conference will be held on Monday and Tuesday, with a mix of presentations, workshops and networking
opportunities.

### Dome

The Dome is an immersive projection dome capable of showing both 3D and 2D content. It was the first of its kind in the
entire world. During the conference we'll have two sessions in the Dome, free for all conference participants.

### Visual City

Our venue is the home to the [Visual City](https://visualiseringscenter.se/en/exploranation/visual-city/), a three-dimensional
physical model of Norrköping. Using the Visual City various data sets can be visualized, but not only that: During the conference
you will have the opportunity to see your own visualization come to life on the model!

The model is available for exploration during the entire conference, with two guided sessions.

We invite you to contribute your own QGIS-made maps to the interactive 3D-printed city model, an installation that blends
geodata, projection mapping, and Unreal Engine. This unique platform offers visitors a tangible way to explore urban planning,
data layers, and spatial narratives. Additionally, the best visualization will be awarded a prize at the closing session. More
information is sent out to all participants.
