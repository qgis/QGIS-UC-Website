## Signal

For communication between participants during the conference we have created a Signal group.

We will also use this group to send out important information during the conference, such as changes in the schedule and other announcements.

In order to prevent spam the link to join the group is only sent out the registered conference participants. Check your spam folder if you have not received it.

## QField

QField is a mobile app for field data collection and editing, built on QGIS. It allows you to access your QGIS projects
and data on your mobile device, enabling you to work in the field without needing an internet connection.

QFieldCloud/OPENGIS.ch have graciously provided us with a QField project providing a lot of information about the conference:

* Fully searchable conference schedule
* Multifloor rooms selector
* Real-time public transport information (bus locations & departure boards)
* Points of interest - restaurants, hotels, bars, and more
* A private memory layer - take your own notes, photos, videos, and audio

Everything (except real-time data) works entirely offline.

To get started, install QField on your device and scan the QR code or visit [onelink.to/uc-2025](https://onelink.to/uc-2025).

Note: Requires version QField 3.6, which is currently rolling out. Check your app
store to make sure you've got the latest version, or install it from [Github](https://github.com/opengisch/QField/releases/latest)
