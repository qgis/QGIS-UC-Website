## Signal

For communication between participants during the conference we have created a Signal group.

We will also use this group to send out important information during the conference, such as changes in the schedule and other announcements.

In order to prevent spam the link to join the group is only sent out the registered conference participants. Check your spam folder if you have not received it.

## Conference App

The **conference program is available in the official conference app**, giving you everything you need for the event directly on your phone — even when you’re offline.

Using the app, you can:
* Browse a **fully searchable conference schedule**
* **Mark your favourite talks** and easily plan your personal agenda
* Find your way with a **multi-floor room selector**
* Check **real-time public transport information**, including bus locations and departure boards
* Discover nearby **restaurants, hotels, bars, and points of interest**
* Create your own **private notes, photos, videos, and audio recordings** to capture ideas and memories

Most features work entirely offline, so you can rely on the app throughout the conference.

The app is powered by [QField](https://qfield.org), the mobile QGIS app for field data collection, and is provided thanks to [QFieldCloud](https://qfield.org) and [OPENGIS.ch](https://OPENGIS.ch).


To get started, install QField on your device and scan the QR code or visit [onelink.to/uc-2026](https://onelink.to/uc-2026).
