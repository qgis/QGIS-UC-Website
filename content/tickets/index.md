# Tickets

Tickets will start selling in March. A ticket gives you access to the conference including the Social Dinner and the tickets needed for the gondola. There is no difference between the Early Bird ticket and the Standard ticket, except the price and that Early Bird tickets are only available in a limited amount.

All participants need a ticket for the conference, including speakers and workshop presenters.

Some additional activities, such as the extra **Workshop Day**, require separate registration. These can be added during ticket purchase or later, subject to availability. Please note that **places are limited**.

Tickets can be refunded if cancelled **more than 30 days before the event**.  
Cancellations made **less than 30 days prior** to the event are **non-refundable**.

We reserve the right to cancel any of the social activities if there are too few participants for it, in which case you will be offered a refund.
