## Workshop & Onboarding Day


For those who want to dig even deeper we are planning an additional workshop day on the 7th October. During this day you
will be able to attend longer workshops and get more hands-on experience with QGIS and the community.

Additionally, this day will have "onboarding sessions" for those who want to become an active participant in the QGIS
community, with sessions on how to contribute to the project (filing issues, translating, developing code, etc.).

And for those who want to relax a bit after the conference we will also offer two Social Activities.

## Contributor Meeting

Right after the conference, QGIS Contributor Meeting will take place on 7-9 October at a next door venue. This event
is for those who contribute to the development of QGIS. It’s free to join but you are expected to make yourself useful
on improving the QGIS application, documentation or website or do anything else QGIS will benefit from.
