## Where should you stay?

The recommended hotels below are located in Laax Murschetg because the gondola to the conference venue departs from this area, but many additional and often more affordable options nearby are just as easy and convenient. Rental apartments are especially popular in the region and can be an excellent, budget-friendly choice, particularly for longer stays or groups.

Laax village and Flims are both only a short ride away on the free local bus, which runs every 15 minutes and takes about 8 minutes to reach Murschetg. Distances in the area are small and public transportation is reliable, so neighbouring villages such as Trin, Sagogn, and even Ilanz are also good options, all within about a 20 to 25 minute bus ride.

Many apartments and alternative accommodations can be booked through official local platforms such as [Laax Homes](https://www.laaxhomes.com/en/rentals/holidays-rentals-rentals-z0/2-people/available-from-03-10-2026/to-09-10-2026/list-view/
) or the Flims Laax tourism [booking portal](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/holiday-booking/hotels
), as well as through platforms like [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?ss=Flims+Laax+Falera&ssne=Flims+Laax+Falera&ssne_untouched=Flims+Laax+Falera&efdco=1&aid=304142&lang=en-gb&sb=1&src_elem=sb&src=searchresults&dest_id=3758&dest_type=region&checkin=2026-10-04&checkout=2026-10-07&group_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&flex_window=1) and [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Flims-Laax-Falera/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&date_picker_type=calendar&flexible_date_search_filter_type=0&checkin=2026-10-04&checkout=2026-10-07&search_type=unknown&query=Flims%20Laax%20Falera&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=one_week&monthly_start_date=2026-02-01&monthly_length=3&monthly_end_date=2026-05-01&search_mode=regular_search&price_filter_input_type=2&price_filter_num_nights=3&channel=EXPLORE&adults=1).

## Recommended hotels with conference rates

These hotels are recommended because of their location in Laax Murschetg, where the gondola to the conference venue departs, making access especially easy. The conference rates apply to all room categories and are valid for both conference participants and accompanying persons. Early arrivals and extended stays are also covered, provided they fall within the period 2–11 October 2026.

Availability is limited, so we recommend booking early.
