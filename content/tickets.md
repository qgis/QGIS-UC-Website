# Tickets

A ticket gives you access to the conference including the Social Dinner. There is no difference between the Early Bird ticket and the Standard ticket, except the price and that Early Bird tickets are only available in a limited amount.

Some additional activities require registration and in some cases cost a little bit extra. [Read more about the activities](/activities/). You can add them during registration to the main conference, or later by contacting us at [uc2026@qgis.ch](mailto:uc2026@qgis.ch).

We reserve the right to cancel any of the social activities if there are too few participants for it, in which case you will be offered a refund.
