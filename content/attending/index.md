## The hosting region

The conference takes place in the Surselva valley, one of the few regions in Switzerland where the [Romansh language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sursilvan) is still part of everyday life. You may notice that places here often carry more than one name, shaped by centuries of history and language. Mountain names, valleys, and landmarks frequently preserve older words, echoing the landscape they describe.

This linguistic diversity is woven into local culture and identity, appearing on signs, maps, and in everyday conversations throughout the region.

### Understanding local place names

- **Crap Sogn Gion**  
  The Romansh name of the mountain above Laax where the conference venue is located. *Crap* means “rock”, *Sogn* means “saint”, and *Gion* refers to Saint John.

- **Laax Murschetg**  
  The main arrival point for the conference and a primary accommodation area (Rocks Resort, Hotel Signina, Riders Hotel and many apartments). It is home to the gondola station and bus hub, making it a convenient base for attending the event. Bus stop: **Laax Bergbahnen**.

- **Laax (Laax town, Laax Dorf)**  
  The main village in the valley, offering shops, restaurants, services, some hotels and many apartments. It is connected to Laax Murschetg by a frequent, free local bus service. Bus stop: **Laax Posta**.

- **Flims/Flem**  
  A nearby village with additional accommodation options and services. Flims is well connected to Laax Murschetg by frequent public transport and free local buses.

Beyond the conference, the region is a true [outdoor playground](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/).
