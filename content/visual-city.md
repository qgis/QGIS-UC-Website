# Visual City Participant Exhibition

Discover the power of geospatial storytelling at the Visual City – where your map becomes part of an immersive 3D experience.

We invite you to contribute your own QGIS-made maps to our interactive 3D-printed city model, an installation that
blends geodata, projection mapping, and Unreal Engine. This unique platform offers visitors a captivating and tangible
way to explore urban planning, data layers, and spatial narratives.

# Competition

We invite all conference participants to send in a map of Norrköping for visualization on the 3D model. A jury will
select the best/most inspiring map, which will be available for projection on the 3D model during the conference and receive a price
at the closing session.

This is your chance to display your own work of Norrköping, connect with other QGIS users, and explore a truly
next-level way to visualize cities.

Base datasets are available [here](https://gunet-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/fredrikl_gvc_gu_se/EiB2FSEm9SpHjpFzxcHuNZABSExVAym22FP7qottQELtxg?e=u0lI99). Your map should be prepared as either a
GeoPackage (.gpkg) or GeoTIFF (.tif) in SWEREF99 16 30 (EPSG:3010). The extent should not be beyond the data extent
found in the base datasets. Please send your map to uc2026@qgis.ch, the deadline for submissions is **May 28th**.

# Demonstration Session

* You'll learn how QGIS maps can be published onto the 3D model
* We'll showcase the full pipeline – from GIS to interactive projection
* You'll see how maps and spatial data becomes an engaging and collaborative medium for communication

The map on which the workflow will be demonstrated is the winner of the [Visual City competition](#competition).

[The demonstration will be held on Monday at 15:00-15:30 in the Exhibition Area](https://talks.osgeo.org/qgis-uc2026/talk/EHLGUR/).
