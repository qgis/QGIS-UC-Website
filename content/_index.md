## Welcome to the Swiss Alps!

The QGIS User Conference is an annual event that brings together users and developers of the QGIS open-source geographic information system (GIS). The conference offers an opportunity to discover the latest developments in QGIS, share real-world experiences, and network with the global QGIS community across administrations, industry, academia, and beyond.

The next conference will take place on **5–6 October 2026** in **Laax, Switzerland**, in the heart of the Swiss Alps.

In addition to the main conference days:
- an **informal active outdoor pre-event day** is planned for **4 October 2026**  
- a dedicated **workshop day** will follow on **7 October 2026**, offering hands-on sessions and deeper technical dives
- the **QGIS Contributor Meeting** will be held from **7–9 October 2026**, bringing together active contributors for collaboration and planning
- **QField Day** will take place on **7 October 2026**, focusing on mobile data collection workflows and real-world use cases


The detailed program will be published closer to the event. In the meantime, you can explore a recent edition to get a feel for what to expect on the [QGIS User Conference 2025 website](https://uc2025.qgis.org/).

Set right next to the [**Tectonic Arena Sardona**](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/natural-phenomena/tectonic-arena-sardona) UNESCO World Heritage Site, the venue offers breathtaking panoramic views over the surrounding mountain landscape of the Surselva valley, one of the few [Romansh-speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sursilvan) regions in Switzerland.

Beyond the conference, the region is a true [outdoor playground](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/). Participants can enjoy **mountain biking** and **hiking** and **paragliding** flights directly from the venue, and refreshing breaks at [**Caumasee**](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/mountain-lakes/lake-cauma), one of Switzerland’s most iconic mountain lakes. Nearby, the [**Rhine Gorge**](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/natural-phenomena/rhine-gorge), often called the Swiss Grand Canyon, adds another spectacular highlight with its dramatic cliffs and turquoise waters.
