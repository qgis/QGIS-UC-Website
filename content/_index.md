Set right next to the [**Tectonic Arena Sardona**](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/natural-phenomena/tectonic-arena-sardona) UNESCO World Heritage Site, the venue offers breathtaking panoramic views over the surrounding mountain landscape of the Surselva valley, one of the few [Romansh-speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sursilvan) regions in Switzerland.

Beyond the conference, the region is a true [outdoor playground](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/). Participants can enjoy **mountain biking** and **hiking** and **paragliding** flights directly from the venue, and refreshing breaks at [**Caumasee**](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/mountain-lakes/lake-cauma), one of Switzerland’s most iconic mountain lakes. Nearby, the [**Rhine Gorge**](https://www.flimslaax.com/en/outdoor-activities/natural-phenomena/rhine-gorge), often called the Swiss Grand Canyon, adds another spectacular highlight with its dramatic cliffs and turquoise waters.
